UFID : 2169-8969

Build:

To compile the project just run 'make'

Usage:

To view the output of an RPAL program simply pass the path of the program
to the executable. For example:

	./p2 tests/add
	
This will yeild the results of the RPAL program in the file tests/add.

Flags:

The following flags are all defined.

	-ast   : Display the abstract syntax tree created by the parser.
	-st    : Display the abstract syntax tree after standardization.
	-cs    : Display the control structures generated by flattening.
	-ex    : Display the control / execution stack during execution.
	-l     : Display the file passed into the program.
	-noout : Do not display output.
	
These flags can be run by running a command similar to the following:

	./p2 -ast -st -ex tests/add
	
Testing:

In order to test to ensure that all test cases are working the make file
contains the following helpful testing scripts:

make testast  : Tests all test cases for a matching ast.
make testst   : Tests all test cases for a matching st.
make testfull : Tests the output of all test cases.
